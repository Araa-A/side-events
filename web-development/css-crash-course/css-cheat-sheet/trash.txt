			<h3>Stanza II</h3>
			<small>Ada Lim√≥n</small>
			<p>When we moved out here together, I kept apologizing
				for everything, like a poor orphan in the film about my shame.
				<br>
				<br>He had to tell me to stop. And for days, (maybe weeks?)
				I'd hear it in my mind and have to hold it there,
				stuck like a cockroach under a glass,
				waiting for someone braver to kill it.
				<br>
				<br>Mostly, I enjoy my failings. Until I don't.
				<br>
				<br>In the text from my ex about the bus, he sounds almost funny.
				Like isn't it ironic that I got hit by a bus, when all I ever wanted was to
				disappear without a trace.</p>
