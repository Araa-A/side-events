			<h3>The Exaltation of Inana</h3>
			<small>By high priestess Enheduanna</small>
			<p>Mistress of the divine, resplendent light,
			   <br>Woman of radiance, righteous and beloved
			   <br>Of An and Urac - Heaven's Mistress! - breasts
			   <br>Bejeweled; cherishing the headdress of your priestess -
			   <br>She who grasps the seven sacred powers!
			   <br> Goddess, protector of the powers, and giver -
			   <br>Behold your necklaced hand and fingers. Yours,
			   <br>The gathering of the powers and yours to clasp
			   <br>Against your breast. In foreign lands your breath
			   <br> Is like the dragon's venom. When like Ickur
			   <br>The earth receives your roar, neither leaf nor wood
			   <br> Withstand you. You are as a mighty flood
			   <br> To foreign lands, the might of earth and heaven, you
			   <br> Are their Inana.</p>

			<h3>Scheherazade</h3>
			<small>By Richard Siken</small>
			<p>Tell me about the dream where we pull the bodies out of the lake
				<br>and dress them in warm clothes again.
				<br>How it was late, and no one could sleep, the horses running
				<br>until they forget that they are horses.
				<br>It's not like a tree where the roots have to end somewhere,
				<br>it's more like a song on a policeman's radio,
				<br>how we rolled up the carpet so we could dance, and the days
				<br>were bright red, and every time we kissed there was another apple
				<br>to slice into pieces.
				<br>Look at the light through the windowpane. That means it's noon, that means
				<br>we're inconsolable.
				<br>Tell me how all this, and love too, will ruin us.
				<br>These, our bodies, possessed by light.
				<br>Tell me we'll never get used to it.</p>

			<h3>The Way Under the Way</h3>
			<small>By Mark Nepo</small>
			<p>For all that has been written,
				<br>for all that has been read, we
				<br> are led to this instant where one
				<br>of us will speak and one of us will
				<br>listen, as if no one has ever placed
				<br>an oar into that water.</p>
