// analogWrite("pinNumber","value between 0-255");  the value 0-255 corresponds to 0-5 volts

//this command uses - pulse width modulation: 
// this means that the Volts are only either 0 or 5 
// but pulse on and off at a speed that is dependent on what value you are using.


// how to view it: imagine a person is running at a speed of 5mph, 
// for 0.1 seconds before they stop for 0.1 seconds. 
// from your perspective it would appear that the person is running at a speed of 2.5mph 
// even though they are actually only ever running at a speed of either 5mph or 0mph
